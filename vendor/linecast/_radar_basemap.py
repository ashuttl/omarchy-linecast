"""Braille geography layer for the radar view.

Coastlines and borders are drawn in braille at 2x4-dot-per-cell resolution;
the sea is a solid block-colour fill at half-block (sub-pixel) resolution so
the weather radar can blend over it at full resolution.  This module loads
the vendored Natural Earth data, rasterises a land/sea mask, and produces
per-cell braille dot masks + colours, a sub-pixel sea mask, and city label
overlays for a given geographic window.

Data: Natural Earth (public domain, 1:50m), simplified globally by
prototype/build_basemap_data.py → data/basemap.json.gz.  Per view we clip to
the visible bounding box so a whole-world dataset stays cheap to rasterise.
