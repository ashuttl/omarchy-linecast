"""Street-mode cartography — the single source of truth for map style.

Pure data and pure functions: every colour, threshold, glyph, adapter
and label rule that street mode needs, with no file or network access
and no state.  Imports are limited to the stdlib plus ``_color`` and
``_theme`` so this module can be imported from anywhere (including a
test) without dragging in the renderer.

The design intent, condensed: the terminal is not a small screen, it is
a coarse one.  A braille cell holds exactly one ink, so hierarchy is
carried by luminance ladder first and stroke weight second — no
casings, no shadows, no second accent.  The single warm mark on the map
is the motorway; the single bright mark on the screen is the user.
Type is the scarcest resource on the page, so a label that cannot be
placed cleanly is dropped, never nudged and never shrunk.

Nothing here is mode-conditional beyond the two entries in ``MODES``
and the opening zooms beside them.  Terrain mode keeps its own palette
and borrows exactly two things from this module: those zooms, and the
waterway band gates it needs to draw a river at the same size street
mode would.  The sky overlays (daylight, clouds) are toggles over
either mode, not a mode — they live in _globe_now.

    tier-1 glyphs would be near-absent for the bottom half of B6 and
    then pop in — an empty promise.  Overzoom past z14 is pure geometry
    scaling, and B6/B7 sharing one tile set is perfect cache reuse.

    Below that, the source runs LOOKAHEAD zooms *ahead* of the style

    4 named streets where z14 carries 219.  Everything drawn is gated on

    the line weight tables, the POI tiers — so a deeper tile cannot add
    ink the band did not ask for.  It only widens the choice the gates
    are choosing from.  Measured over that same view, going z12 -> z14
    changed 0.1% of fill sub-pixels and 1.6% of braille dots, and took
    hover from naming 8% of road cells to naming 69%.

    The lookahead is 2 rather than "always 14" because tile count is
    4x per zoom and a view has to be paid for cold: two zooms is 8-12

# so the only thing that separates a sidewalk from a park trail is where
# it runs — and that is the honest test anyway.  A path is dropped where

# *screen* can separate: at any wider view a sidewalk lands on its road
# or a dot off it, twelve metres is less than a dot, and a metric floor
# alone would hide nothing.  Whichever is bigger wins, so the rule holds
