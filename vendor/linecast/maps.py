"""Maps — a street map and a terrain map in the terminal.

`--view street` (the default) is in _maps_streets and friends: vector
tiles rasterised into fills, braille strokes and labels.  Only a handful
of things on it can afford a label, so the pointer is the other half of
reading it: hover names whatever owns the ink under it and lights that
whole feature up (_maps_hover).

`--view terrain` lives here, drawn in a schematic register: colour is
categorical (flat land-cover fields, flat hypsometric bands climbing
green through straw and ochre into mauve, lavender and summit white)
while a multidirectional hillshade underneath carries everything
physical — the grammar of a geologic map rather than a photograph.
The sea is the one smooth gradient, falling to a near-black navy
abyss.  Lakes and rivers are the one thing elevation cannot tell you —
a terrarium sample over a lake is just the height of its surface — so
the inland water comes from the street tiles and joins the shoreline
the elevation already draws.
Geography keeps the radar view's braille identity: the coastline is the
sea-level contour of the elevation data itself (so it always matches
the fill), borders are Natural Earth braille strokes, cities are
labelled dots.  Drag to pan, +/- to zoom, and hover to read the
elevation under the pointer.

    `elev` is meters at w×h (h = 2 rows per cell); None renders as plain

    exaggerated relative to the pixel size so relief reads at any zoom.

    `water` is the optional sub-pixel inland mask.  It wins over both
    ramps, at either sign: a lake takes the lake tint whether it sits on
    a mountainside or four hundred metres below the sea, because it is
    inland water in both cases and the bathymetric ramp would read as
    open ocean.  Its shading is nearly flat — a lake surface is flat,
    and the land slope underneath it is not its slope.

    `cover` is the optional sub-pixel land-cover grid (indices into
    style.COVER_ORDER, 0 = none).  A covered land sub-pixel blends the
    class tint over its hypsometric base — hillshade carries the relief,
    colour carries the ground.  Cover never touches water at either
    sign: a forest polygon generalised over a fjord stays the fjord's.

              16-colour and `none` palettes paint no ground at all.
    layer:    a ranked DotLayer (.dots/.color/.ribbon), one per view.
              Every stroke class has already settled its ink contest by
              rank, so the composer just reads the winner.
    overlays: {(col, row): (char, ink_or_None[, bold])}; ink None picks
              for contrast, a truthy third element renders bold.
    strokes:  extra braille layers over the top (the route), lowest
              priority first — the same ordered-list rule
              compose_terrain uses, because these arrive from outside
              the view's own rank contest.
    hot:      cells whose *braille* draws the feature under the pointer.
              They keep their own ink, lifted toward the top of its
              ladder and set bold — no fourth accent, and bold is the
              same lift one rung coarser once the palette is 16 colours.
    hot_glyphs: cells whose *character* names that same feature — its
              own label, or the glyph if the pointer is on one.  Kept
              apart from `hot` because a label crossing a hovered road
              shares cells with it while belonging to something else
              entirely: lighting a cell asks what is printed in it.

    A sibling of compose_terrain, not a replacement: terrain resolves a
    basemap, a coast mask and an ordered strokes list per cell, street
    resolves one pre-ranked layer plus the motorway ribbon, and neither
    shape fits the other without a pile of mode conditionals.

    Two degradation rules live here so the rest of street mode never
    thinks about colour depth.  A cell with an unpainted sub-pixel is
    left unpainted entirely — that is the 16-colour "mixed land/water
    cell" rule, where the coast stroke carries the boundary instead of
    a half-and-half block.  And in `none` mode every cell without a
    glyph or a braille dot is a literal space: halfblock() with empty
    escapes returns a bare ▄ that would flood the screen, and the line
    map that results is the mode's whole character.
