"""Street-mode labels — the scarcest resource on the page.

Four inks, two cases, and a budget of about sixteen labels for the whole
view.  Everything here follows from that scarcity: candidates are
ranked, walked in strict priority order, and a label that cannot be
placed cleanly is **dropped** — never nudged, never shrunk, never
abbreviated.  Only road labels and shields may move at all, and only by
sliding along their own line to a different horizontal run.

The other governing rule is determinism under pan.  Sort keys carry no
screen coordinate (park names are the one exception, and screen-bbox
area is stable under translation), features from several tiles are
ordered by tile key before sorting, and the occupancy grid is filled
strictly in priority order.  A label that survives at one pan position
survives at the next unless its cells genuinely collide — no flicker, no
shuffling.

Two measurements shaped what is here, both worth knowing before anyone
"fixes" it back:

*Roads.* A cell is two dots wide and four tall, so a road a few degrees
off horizontal changes row every seven columns or so; over downtown
Portland the longest stretch of road holding a single row is 7 cells
where the names want 15.  Requiring a label to sit along a flat run
therefore labelled almost nothing.  Writing the name across the road
instead — horizontally, centred on a cell the road passes through —
labels 29 of 33 named roads in the same view, and reads the way a
paper map does.  Following the line character by character was tried
and rejected: on a cell grid it renders as falling confetti.

*Water.* OpenMapTiles' `water_name` generalisation is inverted for
small features.  Every gut, narrows and thorofare on the Maine coast is
in the tile from z8, while Casco Bay and Sebago Lake do not appear
until z10 — so a three-county view labelled itself "Jaquish Gut" and
"The Gut" while the Gulf of Maine, whose own anchor point sits seventy
cells off the right edge, went unnamed.  Hence the class gates, the
Natural Earth switch below band 3 (that list is area-ranked and
generalised for exactly this scale), and labelling the water you can
see rather than the point the data hands you.

    A tile's `water_name` is a bare point.  It carries no extent, and on
    a coast it carries no identity either: measured over Casco Bay, Back
    Cove, Lamson Cove, Hussey Sound and eleven more all land inside the
    one `ocean` polygon, so there is nothing in the data to ask how far
    any of them reaches.  Naming the whole connected component after one
    of them is what an alphabetical tie-break was doing — Back Cove
    beats Diamond Cove by a letter and inherits the Atlantic.

    So a name claims the water *nearest to it*, walked over the water
    rather than measured across the land between: the flood out of Back
    Cove has to go under Tukey's Bridge to reach the harbour, which is
    exactly the distance a reader tracing it with a finger would feel.
    Where two names meet, the boundary lands in the narrows between
    them, which is where anyone would draw it.

    And a name reaches only so far — `style.WATER_CLAIM_REACH` times the
    half-width of the water it stands in — because a point on the shore
    of Lake Michigan naming a boat anchorage should not thereby name the
    lake.  Past every claim the water is left to the caller, which has a
    better answer than a wrong name.

    The exception is the sole name on a body, reaching the middle of it.
    The anchor `water_regions` found is the cell most central to the
    shape, so a name whose claim covers it is not naming a gut off the
    side of something bigger — and with nothing else on the water there
    is nothing it could be taking.  That is Sebago Lake, whose point
    sits mid-lake and whose reach would otherwise stop two thirds of the
    way to either end.

    Both halves of that are load-bearing.  Without the anchor test, the
    Playpen — an anchorage on the Chicago shore, and the only name the
    tile offers there — inherits Lake Michigan.  Without the sole-name
    test, the largest cove on a bay full of them takes every stretch the
    others could not reach, which is the bug this whole function exists

    Below band 3 the names come from the bundled Natural Earth marine
    list, exactly as settlements do: it is area-ranked and generalised
    for this scale, so a three-county view is told it is looking at the
    Gulf of Maine rather than at three of its guts.  From band 3 up the
    tile layer takes over, class-gated.

    A `waters` dict, if given, collects {cell: name} for every cell of
    every *named* body on screen, whether or not its name won a place on
    the page.  Naming water is this function's whole job, and the answer
    is worth more than one label: it is what lets a pointer anywhere on
    a lake say which lake, and the label budget has no business
    deciding that.  Bodies are the connected components of the water
    mask, so a name reaches exactly as far as the water a reader would
    trace with a finger — across a narrows, never across the isthmus.

    A body of water gets exactly one *label*.  Several always reach for
    the same one — Back Cove is one region with the bay it drains into,
    and the tile offers "Back Cove", "Lamson Cove" from out past Munjoy
    Hill, and the sewage plant's "Chlorine Contact Tanks" — and writing
    all three across the same water is not three facts, it is two
    mistakes.

    What a body is *called*, cell by cell, is a different question with
    a different answer, and conflating the two is what put "Back Cove"
    on every square inch of Casco Bay: one label is right, one name for
    four thousand cells of bay, harbour and tidal river is not.  So the
    label contest picks one name per region and `water_claims` decides
    how far each name actually reaches.  The two cannot disagree where
    it matters: the contest already prefers a name standing on its own
    point over one dragged in from off the edge, and such a name is a
    seed at distance zero from itself, so the water under a label always
    answers with that label.

    Walked in strict priority order — places, water and park names,
    shields, street names, POI glyphs, POI names — each against its own
    ceiling.  Sub-budgets are ceilings, not reservations: unused place
    slots do not flow to streets.  The page is allowed to be
    under-filled.

    A `marks` dict, if given, collects {cell: (i18n key, name, seq)} for
    the POI glyphs that were actually placed — hover's first lookup, and
    the only one that has to be taken from placement rather than from
    the raster, because a glyph is the one mark that owns cells no
    stroke may claim.  Road and place labels are deliberately absent:
    they are written across the very feature they name, so the ink
    contest underneath already answers for them.

    A `texts` dict collects {cell: name} for exactly those other labels.
    They are not a lookup — hovering the word "Bridge Street" still
    resolves to the road under it — but the reverse direction: hover the
    road and its name should go bold with it, which needs to know where
    the writing landed.  Keyed on the raw name rather than the cased
    text, because that is the name the raster's own index will report.

    A `waters` dict collects {cell: name} for the named bodies of water,
    filled whether or not their names won a place on the page — the
    naming itself happens in water_park_candidates.
