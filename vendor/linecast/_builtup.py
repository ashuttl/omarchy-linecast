"""Built-up surface tiles for terrain's urban tint (GHSL-derived).

An optional raster companion to the street-density proxy: grayscale XYZ
tiles where pixel value 0-255 is the fraction of the cell that is
built, generated from the JRC Global Human Settlement Layer by
scripts/build_builtup_tiles.py.  Measured settlement instead of
inferred — it knows the town whose streets nobody has mapped, and it
is immune to the zoom-dependent street thinning that makes the proxy
wobble.

Enabled by LINECAST_BUILTUP_URL (an XYZ base; file:// works for a
local tile directory).  A missing tile means "nothing built here" by
construction, so misses are cached as empty files and read as zero —
the sparse tileset is the compression.
