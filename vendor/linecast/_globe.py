"""Orthographic globe for planet-scale zooms.

Web Mercator is the right projection for a street you walk and the
wrong one for a planet you regard: zoomed far enough out, Greenland
balloons, the poles smear into taffy, and there is an edge of the
world.  Past ZOOM_DEG the terrain view hands its geometry to this
module — for each sub-pixel, invert an orthographic projection to a
latitude and longitude (or to space), sample the same terrarium
elevation the flat map draws from, and let the existing paint pipeline
(bathymetry, hypsometry, hillshade, braille coastline) do exactly what
it always does.  Only the geometry changes; the planet keeps its look.

The disk is shaded twice: hillshade inside the paint pipeline, then a
limb falloff by viewing angle out here, which is what turns a round
map into a sphere.  Space gets a one-sub-pixel breath of atmosphere.
