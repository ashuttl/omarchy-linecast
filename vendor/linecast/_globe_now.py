"""The sky over the map: daylight and clouds, as they are right now.

Two independent facts, two independent toggles — `s` shades the map
into tonight's darkness and lights its cities, `c` lays this hour's
clouds over it — and both compose with either register, flat or globe.
Nothing here animates: every repaint draws the newest satellite mosaic
and the sun's actual position, and a slow nudge in maps.py (every half
hour) keeps a long-running view honest without ever playing frames.

Clouds ride the LibreWXR global infrared mosaic that already feeds the
radar view's satellite layer: alpha is cloud opacity, coverage runs to
about the 72nd parallels, and the newest frame trails real time by an
hour or two.  Poleward of the geostationary ring a coarse Open-Meteo
cloud-cover lattice stands in — model, not satellite, the same trade
the radar view makes where no radar reaches — fading in exactly where
the mosaic's own feathered edge fades out, so a pole-centred globe
doesn't wear a moat of suspiciously clear sky.  Daylight is astronomy — the subsolar
point from the clock and a civil-twilight ramp — and night dims to a
readable blue rather than black, because a map you cannot read is not
a map.  Cities burn through the dark side, graded by population: the
basemap's own registry doing its best Black Marble.
