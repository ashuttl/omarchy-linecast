"""Street mode — OpenMapTiles vector tiles rasterised for the terminal.

The half of street mode that turns tiles into pixels: pick the source
zoom for a view, decode the tiles, and paint their polygons into a
dot-resolution class grid that becomes both the area fills and the
coastline.  Line work, labels and POI arrive in later stages; this
module owns the ground the rest of them stand on.

Two rules shape everything here.  **Fills are solid half-blocks and
braille is reserved for line work**, because a braille cell holds
exactly one foreground colour — a stipple fill and a road stroke in the
same cell would have to fight for the ink, and that failure is total
rather than cosmetic.  And **the coastline is the boundary of the fill
mask that produced it**, never a second dataset, so the stroke and the
colour edge cannot disagree at any zoom.

Style decisions (which classes, which colours, which bands) all live in
_maps_style; this module only asks it questions.

    segment from its dominant axis; the basemap's (0,0),(1,0),(0,1)
    triple is deliberately not reused, because it thickens diagonals and
    reads as fuzz.  Weight 3 adds every touched cell to `layer.ribbon`
    for the composer to tint — motorway only, deepest band only.

    `owner` rides along with the ink through the same rank contest, so
    whichever stroke a cell ends up showing is the one hover names.

    `hide` is a dot mask the stroke may not draw into — the one way a
    line yields to an area, and used for exactly that: a river centreline
    inside water already wide enough to draw itself.  The dash counter
    runs on through hidden dots, so a suppressed reach costs the pattern
    its phase no more than an off-screen one does.

    `mark` is the mirror: a dot mask the stroke records itself into, for
    a later stroke to be hidden by.  It is written for every dot the
    walker stands on, dashes and hidden reaches included, because it
    records where the *line* runs and not which of its dots got ink — a
    tunnelled road under a park is still a road the path beside it
    belongs to.

    Feature order is irrelevant here — each stroke carries its class
    rank, so a motorway that arrives in the last tile still owns the
    cells it crosses.

    Returns the feature table hover reads: index -> (style key, name).
    Strokes sharing a class *and* a name merge into one entry, so
    hovering any reach of a river lights the river rather than the
    segment the tile happened to cut.  Only `waterway` carries names at
    all in these layers — the road net's are in a different layer
    entirely, and _maps_hover joins them back by cell.

    Nameless geometry is owned one *part* at a time, and that is not a
    detail.  A vector tile is not a list of roads: the encoder merges
    every line sharing a class and its attributes into a single
    multi-part feature, so all of a town's unnamed residential streets
    can arrive as one `feature` with four hundred linestrings in it.
    Owning that per feature makes hovering any back street light the
    whole town.  A part is the honest unit — one continuous run of the
    line, which is as much of a street as the tile is willing to say.

    `water` is the view's dot mask of the water fills.  Given it, a river
    centreline is suppressed wherever the polygon around it is wide
    enough to draw itself — see `open_water`.  The eroded mask is derived
    on the first waterway feature, because most views have none.

    Paths are the one class that cannot be walked in stride, because
    whether a path is drawn depends on where the roads went.  They are
    collected on the way past — owning their feats entries in the order
    they arrive, so nothing downstream can tell — and walked at the end
    against the finished road shadow.  The rank contest makes the delay
    free: a stroke's class decides the cells it keeps, never its turn.

    The coastline is one mask and many things.  Drawn, it is the
    boundary of the whole water mask; read, each stretch of it is the
    rim of *this* lake, and a reader pointing at the edge of Graham Lake
    means Graham Lake and not every shore in the county.  So the mask is
    split by the connected components of the water it goes round — the
    same components the labels named — and each becomes its own feature.

    Both grids point at the same features, which is what lets the middle
    of a lake and its rim answer identically: the fill has no ink of its
    own, so a water cell is filed against the shore that encloses it.

    A component is not always one body, though, and on a coast it
    almost never is: Casco Bay, Back Cove, the harbour and the Fore
    River are one connected sheet of salt water, and filing all of it
    under one name told a reader pointing at the harbour that they were
    looking at Back Cove.  So the unit is the *named claim* — what
    `water_claims` decided each cell is called — and a region is split
    into as many features as it has names on it.  A body the tile never
    named still gets its own feature, one region at a time: "water" is
    all it can say, but it can at least say it about one pond instead of
    about every pond on screen.
